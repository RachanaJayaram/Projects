<h3>
	1. Translating Object Oriented Perl Code to Python
</h3>
<a href="https://rachanajayaram.github.io/Translating-OOPerl-to-Python/">RachanaJayaram/Translating-OOPerl-to-Python</a>
<p>
	This project is an exploration of program translation using compiler design techniques. Given a syntactically
	correct code written in Object Oriented Perl the tool developed here programmatically generates an equivalent code
	in Python which generates identical outputs. Using a lexer and a 2 stage parser, translation of several concepts
	unique to OOPerl to Python was achieved.
	<br>
	<b>
		Language :
	</b>
	Python, Perl. <br>

	<b>
		Tools & technologies used :
	</b>
	Python Lex and Yacc library.

<h3>
	2. Automatic Questionnaire Generation from Lecture Videos
</h3>

<p>
	This project involves interleaving lengthy lecture videos with questionnaires at optimal moments in order to keep
	students’ attention. MCQ type questions are generated based on the transcript of the video lecture using ML and NLP
	techniques. In order to maintain continuity and proper flow of teaching, a LDA-based model is used to insert these
	generated questions at appropriate points during the lecture.
	<br>
	Our short paper on “Automatic questionnaire and interactive session generation from videos” was accepted for the 3rd
	International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science 2020.

		Tools & technologies used :
	</b>
	Spacy, Keras, Natural Language Toolkit, Sklearn.

<h3>
	3. Malware Prediction
</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/RachanaJayaram/MalwarePrediction">RachanaJayaram/MalwarePrediction</a>
<p>
	Using machine learning models to predict the probability of a windows system getting infected by various families of
	malware, based on different properties of that system. This was done by using gradient boosting frameworks, namely a
	LightGBM model on Microsoft's 'Malware Prediction' dataset.

<h3>
	4. Image Encryption with Chaos Theory

</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/RachanaJayaram/ImageEncryptionChaosMaps">RachanaJayaram/ImageEncryptionChaosMaps</a>

<p>
	This is a project in cryptography that involved implementing image encryption using various chaos maps and comparing
	their
	merits based on key sensitivity, adjacent pixel autocorrelation and intensity histograms. The chaos maps implemented
	were - Arnold cat maps, Henon maps and Logistic chaos maps.

<h3>
	1. Elective Registration Portal - DBMS
</h3>
<p>
	The project involved making a mock elective registration website for our university. Using this portal, students can
	sign up for electives of their choice and teachers can monitor the head-count of students enrolled in their
	elective.

<h3>
	2. Visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm
</h3>
<p>
	A teaching tool that is used easily visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm which is used to find the shortest path
	from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a given graph.
